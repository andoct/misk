* Design with multisig in mind. Data model needs to accommodate.
* Figure out how to generate multi-sig addresses
* Decide that maybe we only persist the account level pub/prv
  - Re-read hardened nuances to decide this ^^
  - Cannot derive a hardened key from a public key because the private key is used as input when
    creating a hardened child.


Importing pubkeys for multisig from other wallets. Use Bip32 pub/prv format
DeterministicKey#deserializeB58
DeterministicKey#deserialize (bytes)
  Check for prefix to indicate public or private

BIP 45 for multisig
m / purpose' / cosigner_index / change / address_index
purpose = 45'
Won't be compatible with our existing setup but we can use this for new multisig.
